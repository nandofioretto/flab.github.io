**\-** I am co-organizing the first Summer School in AI and OR ([AISCORE](https://ai-score.github.io)).

<br> **\-** I gave a talk on _[Disparate impacts of compression in Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjJ40BU31vw&t=1572s)_ at **[BuzzRobot](http://buzzrobot.com)**.

<br> **\-** Two papers accepted to **[ICML 2024](https://icml.cc/Conferences/2024)**! [On The Fairness Impacts of Hardware Selection in Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03886), and [Disparate Impact on Group Accuracy of Linearization for Private Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03629). :sparkles:
