I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science). 
I lead the [Responsible AI for Science and Engineering (RAISE)](/group/) group where we make advances in artificial intelligence with focus on two key themes:\\
  **AI for Science and Engineering**: We develop the foundations to blend deep learning and constrained optimization for complex scientific and engineering problems.\\
  <!-- and  create ways to integrate knowledge, constraints, and physical principles into learning models. -->
  **Trustworthy & Responsible AI**: We analyze the equity of AI systems in support of decision-making and learning tasks, focusing especially on privacy and fairness.


<!-- I am a recipient of the _2022 AWS Amazon Research Award_, the _2022 NSF CAREER award_,
the 2022 _Google Research Scholar Award_, the _2022 Caspar Bowden PET award_, the
_2021 ISSNAF Mario Gerla Young Investigator Award_, the _2021 ACP Early Career Researcher Award_,
the _2017 AI*AI Best AI dissertation award_, and _several best paper awards_.
