I am assistant professor in the [CS department](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science)
at the [University of Virginia](https://virginia.edu).

My work makes advances in foundational Artificial Intelligence (AI) research with focus on two key themes:

- **AI for Science and Engineering**. It develops the foundations to blend deep learning and combinatorial optimization to serve the resolution of complex scientific and engineering applications and creates novel ways to integrate knowledge, constraints, and physical principles into learning models.
- **Responsible AI**. It analyzes the equity of AI systems in support of decision-making and learning tasks, and it designs practical algorithms to make AI systems more aligned with societal values, focusing especially on privacy and fairness.

I approach these directions by applying the tools and perspectives of optimization theory, differential privacy, and statistics to problems in decision-making and machine learning. For more details, please see my publications.
My research is generously supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), Google, Amazon, and Syracuse University.
I am a recipient of the 2022 AWS Amazon Research Award, the 2022 NSF CAREER award, the 2022 Google Research Scholar Award, the 2022 Caspar Bowden PET award, the 2021 ISSNAF Mario Gerla Young Investigator Award, the 2021 ACP Early Career Researcher Award, the 2018 AI*AI Best AI dissertation award, and several best paper awards. Before joining Syracuse University, I was a postdoctoral research associate at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a research fellow at the University of Michigan. For more details, please see my CV.


<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
