# Responsible AI: Privacy, Fairness, and Robustness Seminar (Spring 25)

## Course Description

This seminar-style course delves into the ethical dimensions of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on the intersectionality of privacy, fairness, and robustness. The course is structured around reading, discussing, and critically analyzing seminal and state-of-the-art papers in the field. Participants will engage in intellectual discourse to understand the challenges, methodologies, and emerging trends related to responsible AI. The course is designed for graduate students with good ML, stats, and optimization background.

## Course Objectives

- Critically assess and discuss the literature on privacy, fairness, and robustness in AI.
- Identify challenges and propose potential solutions for responsible AI.
- Foster interdisciplinary discussions to explore the ethical dimensions of AI.
- Engage in a deep intellectual exploration of the field through paper discussions and presentations.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of machine learning.
- Basic understanding of optimization.

## Assessment

Each group will be assessed through the following activities:

- Paper Summaries (blogging): 33.3%
- Presentation: 33.3%
- Discussion Lead: 33.3%


##### 1. Paper Summaries (Blogging) â€“ 33.3%

**Objective:** To develop the ability to critically analyze and summarize AI research papers in a clear and accessible manner.

**Expectations:**
- Each group will reivew all paper from the provided list, and they may propose additional ones for approval.
- Summaries should be written in Markdown format (supporting images and formulas) and committed to the course's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/uva-responsibleai/spring25/).
- The summary should include the following sections: Introduction and Motivations, Methods, Key Findings, and Critical Analysis.
- The Critical Analysis section should evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, potential biases, and ethical considerations of the paper.
- Summaries must be submitted **four days** prior to the presentation for review and potential feedback at [fioretto@virginia.edu](fioretto@virginia.edu).

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Clarity and coherence of the written summary.
- Depth of critical analysis and understanding of the paper's content.
- Proper use of formatting and adherence to submission guidelines.
- Timeliness of submission.

##### 2. Presentation â€“ 33.3%

**Objective:** To enhance students' ability to communicate complex AI concepts and engage in public speaking.

**Expectations:**
- 45-minute presentation per group.
- Presentations can include slides, code demonstrations, videos, or other creative methods.
- The presentation should cover the key aspects of the paper, including its contribution to responsible AI.
- A critical evaluation of the paper is essential, including discussing its limitations and implications.
- Preparation of thought-provoking questions to stimulate audience engagement.
- Slides must be submitted **one week** prior to the presentation for review and potential feedback at [fioretto@virginia.edu](fioretto@virginia.edu).

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Effectiveness of communication and presentation skills.
- Accuracy and depth of content presented.
- Creativity and engagement in the presentation method.
- Ability to provoke thoughtful discussion through prepared questions.

##### 3. Discussion Lead â€“ 33.3%

**Objective:** To cultivate skills in leading intellectual discourse and fostering collaborative learning.

**Expectations:**
- 30-minute discussion session following the presentation.
- Groups should prepare and facilitate a discussion based on their presentation.
- Use of supplementary materials (e.g., videos, code snippets) to enrich the discussion is encouraged.
- The discussion should engage the audience (with active questions), encouraging diverse viewpoints and deeper understanding of the topic.

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Ability to foster an inclusive and constructive discussion.
- Relevance and depth of prepared questions and discussion points.
- Engagement level of the audience during the discussion.
- Use of supplementary materials to enhance understanding.

### General Notes:
- All group members are expected to contribute equally to each component, but two to three members are expected to lead one of the three components.
- Peer evaluation within groups may be used to ensure fair contribution.

## Recommended Reading

- A curated list of papers will be provided at the start of the course.
