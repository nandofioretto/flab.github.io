# Responsible AI: Privacy, Fairness, and Robustness Seminar

## Course Description

This seminar-style course delves into the ethical dimensions of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a particular focus on the intersectionality of privacy, fairness, and robustness. The course is structured around reading, discussing, and critically analyzing seminal and state-of-the-art papers in the field. Participants will engage in intellectual discourse to understand the challenges, methodologies, and emerging trends related to responsible AI. The course is designed for graduate students with good ML, stats, and optimization background.

## Course Objectives
